## About the author
Hi, I'm Danny Kopping

I'm the **Head of Digital** at [**The Switch Design Company (Pty) Ltd**](http://switchdesign.com) where I build bespoke software solutions that span the desktop, mobile and the web.

I love **PHP**, I'm really impressed with the revival it's going through now and I want to try in whatever way I can to help it along.
